# This is my version of `Camagru` 42 project.

## I had to create a Instagram-like webapp which can be used to take photos, add some filters to them and then share which everybody these artistic works

It was forbidden to use some PHP or JS framework... I bypassed this restriction by turning what was expected from me (discovering the MVC design pattern) into what I wanted to do, ie, CSR + API RESTful. That is what we call the `true freedom`.

Therefore I created a micro-UX framework (like hyperHTML or Vue.js, but really just a bit) which is called `Maverick` in honour of Tom Cruise in Top Gun.

I use Caddy Server to serve my front and proxy requests to my PHP server.

To start Caddy, juste type `caddy` at the root of the repository and then...

Enjoy !
