What tables are necessary ?

-> Users
-> Tokens (sign-up, password recovery processes)

Features :

-> Being able to change its username, password, email
-> Send emails (have to find a way to do that)
-> Authenticated users can comment and like images
-> The author of an image must be alerted by email if someone likes it (this is the default behavior but it can be configured)

-> Pagination : at least 5 images per page
